abstract = "A new strategy for mesh adaptation dealing with Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems is presented using a partitioned approach. The Euler equations are solved by an edge-based Finite Volume solver whereas the linear elasticity equations are solved by the Finite Element Method using the Lagrange $P^1$ elements. The coupling between both codes is realized by imposing boundary conditions. Small displacements of the structure are assumed and so the mesh is not deformed. The computation of a well-documented FSI test case is finally carried out to perform validation of this new strategy. The capability of treating three-dimensional complex cases is also demonstrated."
