abstract = "This work deals with high-order numerical methods for unsteady flows around complex geometries.In order to cope with the low-order industrial Finite Volume Method, the proposed technique consistsin computing on structured and unstructured zones with their associated schemes:this is called a hybrid approach. Structured and unstructured meshes are then coupledby a nonconforming grid interface. The latter is analyzed in details with specialfocus on unsteady flows. It is shown that a dedicated treatment at the interface avoidsthe reflection of spurious waves. Moreover, this hybrid approach is validated on severalacademic test cases for both convective and diffusive fluxes. The extension of this hybridapproach to high-order schemes is limited by the efficiency of unstructured high-order schemesin terms of computational time. This is why a new approach is explored: The Spectral Difference Method.A new framework is especially developed to perform the spectral analysis of Spectral Discontinuous Methods.The Spectral Difference Method seems to be a viable alternative in terms of computational time andnumber of points per wavelength needed for a given application to capture the flow physics."
