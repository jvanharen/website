abstract = "A general framework is proposed to study the unsteady behaviour of nonconforming grid interface between two structured blocks. Using the Finite Volume Method, a two-dimensional spectral analysis is performed for a second order centred scheme to compare with solutions obtained by the elsA software. The nonconforming grid interface makes possible to coarse/refine each block, which is not without effect on both stability and accuracy of the unsteady solution. High coarsening is responsible for instabilities in the form of reflection of high-frequency waves at the nonconforming grid interface. This problem is solved using a high-order interpolation, which depends on metric, and a Riemann solver."
