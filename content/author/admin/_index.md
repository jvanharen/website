I am a Post-Doc in the [GAMMA](https://team.inria.fr/gamma/) team at [INRIA - Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/centre/saclay).
My reasearch interests lie in numerical methods and tools for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
I am working on high-order numerical methods and high-order anisotropic mesh adaptation to perform Large Eddy Simulation around complex geometries.

In 2017, I received my [PhD](files/phd.pdf) in Computational Fluid Dynamics from Toulouse University in collaboration with [CERFACS](https://cerfacs.fr)
and [AIRBUS](https://www.airbus.com) where I worked with [Guillaume Puigt](http://gpuigt.free.fr/index.html)
on high-order numerical methods for unsteady flows around complex geometries.

A PDF version of my CV is available [here](files/cv.pdf).
